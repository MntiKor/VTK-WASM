### Description

This example creates 3 points+vertices. Currently, the address of the picked prop is 0 (this is not correct). A red bounding box is drawn around every picked prop.

- For `vtkInteractorStyleTrackballCamera` - use 'p' to pick at the current mouse position

- For `vtkInteractorStyleRubberBandPick` - use 'r' and left-mouse to draw a selection box used to pick
