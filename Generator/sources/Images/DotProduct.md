### Description

This example demonstrates how to take the pixel-wise dot product of two vector images. The output is a scalar image.

Two images, each 2x2x1, are created and filled with 3-vectors. The dot product of each pair of corresponding pixels is produced by the vtkImageDotProduct filter and output to the screen.
