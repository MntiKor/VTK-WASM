### Description

This example aligns three objects (deformed spheres) using the [Procrustes algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_Procrustes_problem). The original shapes are shown on the left. The alignment using a rigid transform is shown in the middle, and the alignment using a similarity transform is shown on the right.
