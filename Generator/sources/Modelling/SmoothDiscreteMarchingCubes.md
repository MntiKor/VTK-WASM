### Description

Creates surfaces from labeled data. Volume data does not always contain samples of continuous data. A volume may contain discrete integer values, often the result of segmentation. This example smooths the discrete models generated by vtkDiscreteMarchingCubes with vtkWindowedSincPolyDataFilter.
