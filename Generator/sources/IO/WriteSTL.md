### Description

An [STL file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_(file_format)) describes a triangulated three-dimensional surface by the unit normal and vertices (ordered by the right-hand rule) of the triangles. This example saves 3D geometric data stored in a vtkPolyData object to an STL file using vtkSTLWriter.
