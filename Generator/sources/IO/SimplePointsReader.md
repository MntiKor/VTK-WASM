### Description

A file of XYZ coordinates is a very easy format that can be used for
simple storage from many applications. This example demonstrates how
to read this type of file into a polydata object. An example file of
three points would look like this:

``` text
 0.0 0.0 0.0
 1.0 0.0 0.0
 0.0 1.0 0.0
```

As a demo, save the above three lines to a file called simple.xyz and
call the executable resulting from the code below with

``` bash
 ./SimplePointsReader simple.xyz
```

from the build directory.

    For the reverse operation, writing a points file, see the [SimplePointsWriter](../SimplePointsWriter) example.
