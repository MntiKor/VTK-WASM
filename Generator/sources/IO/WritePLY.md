### Description

!!! note
    Unlike vtkPolyDataXMLWriter and most other VTK writers, to write colors to the .ply file you must specify to the vtkPLYWriter:

    plyWriter->SetArrayName("Colors");

    where your color array was created/named like this:

    vtkNew<vtkUnsignedCharArray> colors;
    colors->SetNumberOfComponents(3);
    colors->SetName("Colors");
