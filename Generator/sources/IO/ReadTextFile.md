### Description

This example takes a plain text file of coordinates and reads them into a vtkPoints, which is then put into a vtkPolyData and displayed on the screen using a vtkVertexGlyphFilter.

An example file may look like:
 1 2 3
 4 5 6 
 7 8 9

!!! note
    for a simpler way to read such a file, see [SimplePointsReader](../SimplePointsReader).
