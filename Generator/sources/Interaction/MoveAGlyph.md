### Description

This example allows the user to reposition a glyph. It does this by faking the interactor into thinking that a new actor (MoveActor) is the object to be interacted with. We use the array generated by glyph3D->GeneratePointIdsOn() to determine the point associated with the glyph that the user selected. A "ghost" actor of the selected glyph is generated (because all of the glyphs are part of the same actor, so they would all move together). This actor is moved, and its final position is used to update the point in the original data set.
