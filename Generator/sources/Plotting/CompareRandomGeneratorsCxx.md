## Description

This example demonstrates 6 random number generators offered by c++11. These are now part of the C++ standard. They offer a different API and more generators than presented the vtk generators vtkMinimalStandardRandomSequence, vtkBoxMuellerRandomSequence, vtkGaussianRandomSequence and vtkMersenneTwister.

The vtkRandomSequence generators are used internally by vtk classes, but application developers may prefer to use the C++ standard generators.

The c++ standard random number collections is described [here](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/random/).
