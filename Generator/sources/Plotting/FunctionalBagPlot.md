### Description

This example illustrates how to use the vtkPlotFunctionalBag. This class, depending on the number of components in a column, will either draw a line plot (1 component) or, for two component columns, a filled polygonal band (the bag) going from the first to second component.

The example uses a qualitative color map selected from vtkColorSeries.
