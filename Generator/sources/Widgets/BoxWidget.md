### Description

This example uses a vtkBoxWidget to manipulate an actor. The class includes geometry to draw a box around the object, which is bound to it via *SetProp3D*. The box is dimensioned using the `SetPlaceFactor` method, and positioned with the `PlaceWidget` method. After the initial setup, synchronizing the box with the object is done through a custom callback class, which is passed to the box widget through the `AddObserver` method.

For a widget that isn't tied to a specific vtkProp3D and has its geometric representation separate from the interaction logic, see the example [BoxWidget2](../BoxWidget2).
