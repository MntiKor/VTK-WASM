### Description

This example uses a vtkBoxWidget2 to manipulate an
actor. The widget only contains the interaction logic; the actual box
is drawn by the accompanying vtkBoxRepresentation.  Contrary
to the older vtkBoxWidget, this widget
doesn't provide functionality to assign it to one or more actors, so
that has to be implemented manually. The box is dimensioned and
positioned by passing a bounding box to `PlaceWidget`
method, with the `SetPlaceFactor` method providing a
scaling factor in relation to that bounding box. The transformations
applied to the box can be used to manipulate any number of object(s),
via a custom callback class, which is passed to the box widget through
the `AddObserver` method.

The older implementation vtkBoxWidget provides functionality to receive a vtkProp3D for the initial positioning and sizing, but the transformation synchronization still needs to be done manually. See [BoxWidget](../BoxWidget) for a simple example of how to use it.
