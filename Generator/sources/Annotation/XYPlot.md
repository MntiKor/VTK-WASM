### Description

This example demonstrates the use of vtkXYPlotActor to display three
probe lines using three different techniques.  In this example, we are
loading data using the vtkPLOT3DReader.  We are using the
vtkProbeFilter to extract the underlying point data along three probe
lines.

!!! note
    The image was generated with this volume data: `src/Testing/Data/combxyz.bin` and `src/Testing/Data/combq.bin?raw=true`.
