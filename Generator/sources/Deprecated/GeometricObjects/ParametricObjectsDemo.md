### Description
See [Parametric Equations for Surfaces](http://www.vtk.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/ParametricSurfaces.pdf) by Andrew Maclean for an excellent description of these beautiful parametric surfaces.

This example also demonstrates how to manipulate lists of VTK objects using vectors. Notice how parameters of the various Parametric Objects are accessed and set in the parametricObjects vector.
