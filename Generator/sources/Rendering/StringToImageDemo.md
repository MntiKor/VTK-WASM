### Description

This example demonstrates the use of vtkFreeTypeTools to populate an image with multiple strings converted into images. The final image is created using vtkImageBlend to blend each string image into the final image. If a string image does not fit in the final image or overlaps with an image in final, that sting image is skipped.
