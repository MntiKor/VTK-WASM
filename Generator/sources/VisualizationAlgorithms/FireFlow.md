### Description

The example illustrates how to combine a geometric description of a scene with a fluid flow solution. The vtkVRMLImporter read the geometry file which is  a .wrl file. The file contains 32 actors. The vtkXMLUnstructuredGridReader reads the solution.

vtkStreamTracer generates streamline seeds with points generated by vtkPointSource. vtkContourFilter generates an isosurface of the velocity. A vtkSphereSource shows the sphere used in the vtkPointSource filter.

For an interactive version of this example, see [FireFlowDemo](../FireFlowDemo).

    The solution and geometry data is from the [Mayavi ](https://docs.enthought.com/mayavi/mayavi/) project. Mayavi is a python application that provides an easy to use interface to many vtk filters. Both a command-line and GUI interface are provided. If you use the Mayavi data or the Mayavi application, please use the following citation in any published work:
