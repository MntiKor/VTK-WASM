### Description

This example cuts through structured grid with plane. The cut plane is shown solid shaded. A computational plane of constant value is shown in wireframe for comparison. The colors correspond to flow density. Cutting surfaces are not necessarily planes: implicit functions such as spheres, cylinders, and quadrics can also be used.
