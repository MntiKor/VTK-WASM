### Description

This example renders a high resolution image. The image can be much larger than the window on the screen. It is useful if you need an image for a large poster, or you can down sample the image to produce a high quality anti-aliased image.

The example takes up to three arguments. The first, an input polydata, is required, as is the second, a .png file to hold the high res image. An optional third argument specifies the magnification of the high res image (default 4).
