### Description

This example creates four render windows. Three of the windows will close individually and closing one window will close all the others. Guess which one!

You can also press **'q'** or **'e'** to close a window.

If the parameter **'s'** (C++) or **'-s** (Python) is specified, then updating the camera position in one window will also update the position in the other windows. Pressing **'q'** or **'e'** closes all windows. Note that in this mode you **must** use  **'q'** or **'e'** to close the windows.

!!!Note
   The image you see here is the test image. When you run this program you will see an image similar to [MultipleViewports](../MultipleViewports) however each object will be in a separate window.
