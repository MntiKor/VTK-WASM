### Description
This example demonstrates how to apply a rotation+scaling matrix to each point in a data set. We use a cube as the glyph so that simple rotations are easy to interpret.
Specifically, we glyph one point with no rotation/scaling, and a second point with a rotation of 45 degrees around the x axis.
