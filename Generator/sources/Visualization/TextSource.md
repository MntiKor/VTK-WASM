### Description

This example displays a 3D polygonal text saying "Hello", using the 9x15 font from [X Windows](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System). That is a raster (pixelized) font, so characters are formed by converting the pixels on each character into quadrilaterals. vtkVectorText generates higher quality polygonal representations of text, so it is recommended instead -- see [VectorText](../VectorText) for an example of this.
