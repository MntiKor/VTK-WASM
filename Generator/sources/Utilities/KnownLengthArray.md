### Description

This example creates a VTK style float array. This can be easily interchanged with vtkIntArray, vtkDoubleArray, etc.

The terminology is as follows:

* `SetNumberOfComponents()`: sets the number of elements that a tuple in the array will have. See [VectorArrayKnownLength](../VectorArrayKnownLength) for an example with tuples with more than one element.
* `SetNumberOfValues()`: sets the number of tuples the array will have. See [UnknownLengthArray](../UnknownLengthArray) for an example where the number of values is not known in advance.
