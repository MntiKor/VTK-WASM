### Description

This example demonstrates the GetClassName function. This should be available for every VTK class. This is extremely helpful for debugging - you are able to determine the type of a variable that is passed as an abstract type. With this information, the list of functions that can be called on this variable can be determined.

The example illustrates alternative ways to get the "name" of a class. Notice that the GetClassName provides a simple and useful solution.
