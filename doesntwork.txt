- DataStructures:
KDTreeTimingDemo, ModifiedBSPTreeTimingDemo, OBBTreeTimingDemo, OctreeTimingDemo: Error: no override found for 'vtkContextDevice2D'
VisualizeKDTree: KdTree seems broken

- Filtering:
GenericClip: requires to build vtk with ENABLE_TESTING on, which requires ENABLE_sqlite

- GeometricObjects:
LinearCellDemo, ParametricObjectsDemo: does not compile (vtk_cli11.h missing)
OpenVR*: do I have to explain why ?

- Graphs:
AdjacentVertexIterator: Error: vtkTreeLayoutStrategy: Layout only works if VTK::InfovisBoostGraphAlgorithms is available
BoostBreadthFirstSearchTree: does not compile (InfovisBoostGraphAlgorithms missing)

- IO:
OBJImporter: Index out of bounds (looks like SDL issue)
ReadCML: vtkShaderProgram: Links failed: Varying `vertexVCGSOutput` has static-use in the frag shader, but is undeclared in the vert shader
ReadLegacyUnstructuredGrid: Error: no override found for 'vtkContextDevice2D'

- ImageData:
ImageDataGeometryFilter, ImageNormalize, ImageWeightedSum: no error but bad render

- Meshes:
Subdivision: little glitch, middle sphere isn't actually a sphere

- Rendering:
InterpolateCamera: way too much load, browser freezes for 2-3 min before render loads
Model: only one of the 2 RenderWindow shows, and its interactor is broken
MotionBlur, OutlineGlowPassm, Shadows: does not compile (undefined symbol glPassThrough)
PBR*: missing package (vtk_cli11)
RotationsA,B,C,D: missing Rotations.cxx
WalkCowA,B: missing WalkCow.cxx
SpecularSpheres: low framerate

- Graphs:
AdjacentVertexIterator: Error: vtkTreeLayoutStrategy: Layout only works if VTK::InfovisBoostGraphAlgorithms is available
BoostBreadthFirstSearchTree: does not compile (InfovisBoostGraphAlgorithms missing)
SideBySideGraphs: WebGL warning: blitFrameBuffer: if the source is multisampled, then the source and dest regions must match exactly

- Images:
BackgroundImage: Background render broken
ImageContinuousDilate3D, ImageContinuousErode3D, ImageCorrelation, ImageDifference, ImageMapper: no error but bad render
ImageFFT, ImageRFFT: WebGL warning: blitFrameBuffer: if the source is multisampled, then the source and dest regions must match exactly

 - Shaders:
 BozoShader, BozoShaderDemo, CubeMap, MarbleShader, MarbleShaderDemo, SpatterShader: could not compile vtkShaderProgram
